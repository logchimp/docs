### Background

LogChimp was created by [Yashu Mittal](https://twitter.com/mittalyashu77) in [early 2020](https://github.com/logchimp/logchimp/commit/fb7190a4aa8e1da9ec977dd1d4c8dfab9d536be4) with the idea of building an open-source tool for collecting user feedback.

While other service providers charge their customers anywhere from $50/mo to $200/mo based on the number of tracked users, it can become quite expensive as your user base grows.

The intention was to build a tool that can cater to startups as well as enterprises, and hence the entire LogChimp codebase is open-source [on GitHub](https://github.com/logchimp/logchimp).
