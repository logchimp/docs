## The Maintainers of LogChimp

If you're thankful for LogChimp, you should say thank you to the lovely people at [CodeCarrot](https://codecarrot.net), the amazing company that funded the initial development cost of LogChimp.

AND you should hire us if you want to design and build amazing web applications for you.

But here are the friendly faces of our core contributors of LogChimp, [Yashu Mittal](https://github.com/mittalyashu). You've probably read our names in the thousands of commits, pull requests, comments, or tweets already.
