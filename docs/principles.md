Developing LogChimp as a product is a complex process undertaken by a [small number of people](https://github.com/logchimp/logchimp/graphs/contributors) with a great deal of care.

### Product roadmap

We've maintained a track of 4-6 months of product roadmap which defines the overall direction of the software. While the exact roadmap isn’t shared publicly, the things being worked on are generally very visible on [GitHub](https://github.com/logchimp/logchimp/).

Currently our primary focus is:

- Making LogChimp more flexible and easy to integrate with other apps & services
- Creating a sustainable business models for team to continue working on LogChimp
- Refining and improving the core functionality of the product
