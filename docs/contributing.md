LogChimp is completely open-source software build almost entirely by volunteer contributors for product owners to build a better version of their product.

The best part about open-sourcing software this way is that not only does everyone get to access the source code without restriction, but people all over the world help to improve it.

### Development guide

If you're a developer looking to help, but not sure where to begin: Check out the [good first issue](https://github.com/logchimp/logchimp/labels/good%20first%20issue) label on GitHub, which contains small pieces of work for new contributors.

Or, if you're looking for something a little more challenging, there's a broader [help wanted](https://github.com/logchimp/logchimp/labels/help%20wanted) label encompassing issues which you might be interested in.

### Other ways to help

The primary way to contribute to LogChimp is by writing code, but if you're not a developer here are still ways you can help. We always need help with:

- Maintaining documentation
- Testing and quality assurance
- Promoting LogChimp to others

### Donations

As a [non-profit organization](https://github.com/logchimp/) we're always grateful to receive any donations to help our work.

##### Partnerships

We're very happy to [partner with companies](/partners) who are able to provide LogChimp with credit, goods, and services that help us build free, open software for everyone. Please reach out to us on [LogChimp Discord server](https://discordapp.com/invite/A7mztcC/) if you're interested in partnering with us to help LogChimp.
