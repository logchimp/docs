### Background

LogChimp was created by [Yashu Mittal](https://twitter.com/mittalyashu77) in [early 2020](https://github.com/logchimp/logchimp/commit/fb7190a4aa8e1da9ec977dd1d4c8dfab9d536be4) with the idea to build an open-source tool for collecting user feedback.

As other service providers are charging their customers from $50/mo to $200/mo based on the number of tracked users, and it could get pretty expensive as your user base grows.

Intending to build a tool that can fit anywhere from startup to enterprise and best for all whole LogChimp codebase is open-source [on GitHub](https://github.com/logchimp/logchimp).
