LogChimp is an open-source software to track user feedback built on a modern Node.js and Vue.js technology stack allows product owners to collect user feedback to build better products.

### How is LogChimp different?

The first question most people ask us, of course, how is LogChimp different from other products? Here's a table to give you a brief summary.

## Background

LogChimp was created by [Yashu Mittal](https://twitter.com/mittalyashu77) in 2020 with the idea to build an open-source tool for collecting user feedback.

As other service providers are charging their customers from $50/mo to $200/mo based on the number of tracked users, and it could get pretty expensive as your user base grows.

Intending to build a tool that can fit anywhere from startup to enterprise and best for all whole LogChimp codebase is open-source [on GitHub](https://github.com/logchimp/logchimp).
