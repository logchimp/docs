## Why?

There're many paid products providing the similar service but it comes at greater cost as they set their pricing based on the number of user they're tracking _(a tracked user is anyone who posts, votes, or comments)_ and mostly their base price starts at **$50 to $60 per month with limited number of users to track**.

That's why...

## üîº LogChimp to rescue

I created an open source software for site admins to self-deploy the application and allow them to collect feedback from their users.

The source code of the application is open source on GitHub and contributions / feedback / suggestions are really appreciated.

## üöïTest drive

The process of deploy the application is bit troublesome and I even need to write the documentation for the same.

You're most welcome to self-deploy the application and give it a test drive, please note, I have tried my best to not release any bugs in the initial release but if you find any, please do report back to us in our [Discord server](https://discord.gg/A7mztcC).
