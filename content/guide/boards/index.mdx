## Overview

Boards can be **public** or **private**.
Public boards are visible on your LogChimp site and can be seen by anyone on the internet.

## Configure

Go to `<logchimp-site.com>/dashboard/boards` to **create**, **edit**, and **delete** boards.

Unlike [roadmaps](/guide/roadmaps) you cannot re-arrange the order of boards.
