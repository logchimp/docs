The [Docker Compose Community](https://github.com/logchimp/logchimp/blob/master/docker/community/docker-compose.yml) is officially maintained by the core team.

If `Docker` or `Docker Compose` is not installed on your machine/server, refer to the [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) installation docs.

You can easily kick-start your LogChimp site in 2 easy steps.

<Steps>
	<Step>
		## Step 1. Prepare `.env` file

		Prepare the `.env` file on your server by copying the contents from the `/docker/community/.env.example` file of
		[LogChimp repository](https://github.com/logchimp/logchimp).

		<Alert type="tip">
			You can refer to [Environment Variables](/docs/environment-variables) page to see full list of variables along
			with its description and default values.
		</Alert>
	</Step>

	<Step>
		## Step 2. Run Docker services

		```bash
		docker compose \
		-f ./docker/community/docker-compose.yml \
		--env-file ./docker/community/.env \
		up -d
		```
	</Step>
</Steps>

After running these commands successfully, you can access your LogChimp at `http://localhost:3000`.
