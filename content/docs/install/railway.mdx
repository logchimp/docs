## Behind the scenes

This template will auto-provision the following services for you:

1. PostgreSQL database
2. LogChimp API service
3. LogChimp Theme service

You can always customise the secret keys and other environment variables.

Railway provides an easy way to generate a 32-character secret key by pressing `Command + K` (on MacOS) or `Ctrl + K` (on Windows). Of course, you can provide your own secret key as well.
