#### Does LogChimp support that feature?

No, currently it's not supported. But you're most welcome to [submit a feature request](https://github.com/logchimp/logchimp) anytime.

#### I Want to Consult. What's Your Rate?

Please use GitHub issues to make everything accessible to the whole community if you have a problem, a question, wish to discuss something through, or anything else. For everything else, reach out to [opensource@codecarrot.net](mailto:opensource@codecarrot.net). We can take on a limited number of custom development and consulting contracts.

#### Can We Have a Call?

We can always have a chat on our [LogChimp Discord server](https://discord.gg/A7mztcC). If you really need to reach out in private, send us an email at [opensource@codecarrot.net](mailto:opensource@codecarrot.net), but no technical email support ðŸ˜‰
