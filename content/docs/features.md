LogChimp comes with powerful features build directly into the core software which can be customised on the needs of each individual site.

Here's a quick overview of the main features you'll probaby be interested in as you're getting started.

### Branding

Customise the LogChimp site with your own branding. Just by updating the site settings with color and logo, your brand will reflect all over the site.

### Developer-friendly APIs

At its core LogChimp is a self-consuming, [RESTful JSON API](/content/api). We provide lots of tooling to get a site running as quickly as possible.

### Roles & permissions

Set up your site with sensible user roles and permissions built-in from the start.

- **Contributors:** Can log in and write posts, but cannot publish.
- **Authors:** Can create and publish new posts and tags.
- **Editors:** Can invite, manage and edit authors and contributors.
- **Administrators:** Have full permissions to edit all data and settings.
- **Owner:** An admin who cannot be deleted + has access to billing details.

### Search engine optimisation

LogChimp comes with world-class SEO and everything you need to ensure that your content shows up in search indexes quickly and consistently.

##### No plugins needed

LogChimp has all the fundamental technical SEO optimisations built directly into core, without any need to rely on third party plugins. It also has a far superior speed and pageload performance thanks to Node.js.

##### Canonical tags

LogChimp automatically generates the correct `rel="canonical"` tag for each post and page so that search engines always prioritise one true link.
