A short guide to run LogChimp in a production environment.

We offer official guide and docker image _(coming soon)_ for self-hosting LogChimp.

Our officially recommended stack is:

- Ubuntu 18.04
- PostgreSQL 12
- Node.js 12.18.4

**Ubuntu 18.04** are the only officially supported operating systems. Our [Ubuntu install guide](/content/docs/install/overview) walks you through how to get a server setup this way.

Other operating systems may work fine and you're welcome to use them, but we are unable to assist with debugging or optimising for them at present - so you're on your own there. Our recommendation: Use Ubuntu, because that's where you'll have the fewest headaches.

## Troubleshooting

If you're having trouble with running LogChimp, here's a quick guide to resolving almost any problem.

### Search the docs

We're adding more to the documentation about of the most common problems which people have running LogChimp, so chances are if you search these docs you'll find a page about it!
