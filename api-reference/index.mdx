Welcome to the LogChimp API Reference.

- Use the sidebar to browse endpoints by tag
- See request/response examples and schemas
- Try out endpoints using the interactive sandboxes (where available)

If youâ€™re new to LogChimp, start with the [Guide](/guide), then come back here for details on specific endpoints.

LogChimp uses REST-ful APIs to build the backend on which it delivers content to the client side.

## Path & Version

```
/api/{version}/
```

Each API is prefixed with the same path, followed by a specific version. Version strings are required and always start with `v`. The api versioning guide explains the current available versions and stability index.

**For example**

```
https://yourdomain.com/api/v1/
```
